    <h3>Yosemite National Park</h3>
    <img src="Sequoia Trees.jpg" alt="A giant tree">
    <p>Yosemite is in California.</p>
    <p>I saw waterfalls, Sequoia Trees and canyons.</p>
    <p>I like the Sequoia trees the most because they can live more than 3,000 years!</p>
    <h3>Nasa</h3>
    <img src="Astronauts.jpg" alt="A group of astronauts">
    <p>So there are 2 locations for Nasa: Texas and Florida. But the one that I went to is the Texas one.</p>
    <p>I saw a rocket ship, astronauts pictures and some space games.</p>
    <p>I like the flying bird game because it was so much fun.</p>
    <h3>Nine Mile Canyon</h3>
    <img src="Petroglyph.jpg" alt="A huge picture">
    <p>The Nine Mile Canyon is at the eastern Utah.</p>
    <p>I saw canyons, rocks and petroglyphs.</p>
    <p>I like seeing the sight seeing places the most.</p>
